pro ncdfshow,outfile
; this procedure will read and display the attributes
; for every variable found in a netCDF file
; input file will be found by an interactive search
; output file will be text of the information gathered.
;
; COMMAND LINE USAGE: > ncdfshow,'outfilename'
; note that 'outfilename' is a string and must be in quotes.
;
; With the outfile information in hand, the data can be retrieved
; using the commands below, with user input marked by '*'
; and input from the outfile marked by '#'
; the user must supply variable names to store the ID numbers
; created for the file and variable...'fileID' and 'varID' are used here.
; the user must also supply the name of a variable in which to put the data.
; here this is called 'variable_array', but any name would work.
;
; fileID = NCDF_OPEN('filename'*)
; varID = NCDF_VARID(fileID, 'varname'#)
; NCDF_VARGET, fileID, varID, variable_array
; NCDF_CLOSE, fileID
;
; note that 'filename' and 'varname' are strings and must be in quotes
; 'varname' must be exactly as provided in the netCDF file
